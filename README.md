## **Scenario and Use Case**  
**Scenario:** The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation.  
**Use Case:** IoT devices and embedded controllers are used to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance.  
**Target Audience:** Manufacturing companies (automotive, electronics, food processing).  
**Objectives:**  
- Improve production efficiency by 30%.  
- Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.  
- Enable real-time monitoring and remote control.  
- Reduce energy consumption through optimized processes.  


## **PROCEDURE**


### **1. Comparative Analysis Prompt**  
**Prompt:**  
*""Compare and contrast cloud computing and edge computing in terms of latency, scalability, and use-case suitability."."*  

**ChatGPT:**  
Cloud computing offers high scalability and centralized processing, making it ideal for large data workloads. However, it suffers from higher latency since data must travel to remote servers. Edge computing reduces latency by processing data locally and is suited for real-time applications, though it is less scalable compared to the cloud and requires distributed management.

**Gemini:**  
Cloud computing scales easily and works well for heavy data processing, but latency can be high because everything goes to the cloud. Edge computing keeps processing close to the device, giving very low latency, good for IoT and real-time tasks. However, edge setups are harder to manage and may not scale as smoothly as cloud systems.
 

### **2. Experiential Perspective Prompt**  
**Prompt:**  
"As a warehouse supervisor, describe how AI-powered inventory tracking has changed your daily workflow."
**ChatGPT:**  
As a warehouse supervisor, AI-powered inventory tracking has made my work far more efficient. I no longer need to manually check shelves, as the system updates stock levels in real time. It reduces errors, speeds up order processing, and lets me focus on managing staff and resolving issues instead of counting items. My day feels more organized and less stressful.  

**Gemini:**  
From my perspective as a supervisor, AI tracking makes inventory work smoother. I get instant alerts when items run low, and I don’t have to double-check stock manually. It saves time, cuts mistakes, and helps me keep the warehouse running neatly every day.

### **3. Everyday Functioning Prompt**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Explain how AI-assisted scheduling improves day-to-day tasks in a manufacturing unit."*  

**ChatGPT:**  
AI-assisted scheduling automatically assigns tasks based on machine availability, worker shifts, and priority levels. It reduces delays, prevents clashes between job orders, and ensures that machines are used efficiently throughout the day. This leads to smoother operations and better time management.

**Gemini:**  
AI scheduling helps plan daily work more smoothly. It arranges tasks according to machine and worker availability, avoids timing conflicts, and keeps production running without gaps. It makes everyday factory work more organized.

### **4. Universal Prompt Structures**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Describe how a smart factory works using role, task, constraints, and output format."*  

**ChatGPT:**  
Role: You are an industrial automation expert.
Task: Explain how a smart factory operates.
Constraints: Use simple language and limit the explanation to two main features.
Output Format: Short paragraph.

# Response:
A smart factory uses connected sensors and automated machines to manage production efficiently. It can monitor equipment health in real time and automatically adjust workflows based on machine performance.
**Gemini:**  
Role: Act as a manufacturing consultant.
Task: Describe the working of a smart factory.
Constraints: Keep the explanation simple for beginners.
Output Format: 3–4 lines.

# Response:
A smart factory uses sensors, robots, and data analytics to control machines and track production. It can detect issues early and optimize workflow automatically. This makes manufacturing faster and more accurate.

### **5. Prompt Size Limitations**  
**Prompt:**  
"In exactly two sentences, explain how IoT sensors help in improving workplace safety."
**ChatGPT:**  
IoT sensors detect hazardous conditions like gas leaks, high temperatures, or machine vibrations and alert workers immediately. They help prevent accidents by providing real-time warnings and enabling quick action.

**Gemini:**  
IoT sensors constantly monitor the environment and warn workers about dangers. This reduces accidents and keeps the workplace safer.
